# GraviTicTacToe
TicTacToe, but with gravity and board rotation

GraviTicTacToe is just like normal TicTacToe (or Noughts and Crosses), in that you win by having three of your counters in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. However, you can only win if this occurs after the board has rotated and the counters fall due to gravity, making for an interesting twist.

You play by entering a coordinate for your move, 0-2 for the row first, then 0-2 for the column (as this is how Python 2D lists work - I haven't yet made it more user friendly)
